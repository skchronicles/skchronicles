### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github! I am a bioinformatics scientist at [NIAID](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/research-technologies-branch-integrated-data-sciences) and the development team lead at [OpenOmics](https://github.com/OpenOmics). OpenOmics is a collaborative, open-source community on a mission to push science and bioinformatics forward.

We believe in open, reproducible, collaborative scientific research, and the strength of community led efforts. We recognize that together as a group we build strong! OpenOmics serves as a place to connect and engage with other community members, share ideas, and build pipelines & tools that enable the greater scientific community!
